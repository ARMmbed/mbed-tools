"""API to detect any Mbed OS devices connected to the host computer.

It is expected that this package will be used by developers of Mbed OS tooling rather than by users of Mbed OS.
This package uses the https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-targets interface to identify valid Mbed Enabled Devices.
Please see the documentation for mbed-targets for information on configuration options.

For the command line interface to the API see the package https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-tools
