# Azure Pipeline for Build and Release a Python package.
#
# This pipeline performs multiple actions to ensure the quality of the package:
# - Performs static analysis and runs test on multiple Python versions and host platforms.
# - Uploads test coverage to Code Climate
# - Generates reference documentation
# - Optionally releases the software on PyPI

# Rebuild after commits to master for GA releases, beta for pre-release and release branches for patches.
trigger:
  - master
  - beta
  - releases/*

# Trigger on a PR to master, beta or releases branches (this includes PRs from forks but secrets are not exposed).
pr:
  - master
  - beta
  - releases/*
