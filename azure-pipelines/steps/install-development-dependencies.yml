steps:
  # Note
  # The below code generates a pip requirements file from the pipenv development requirements (also obtaining the
  # normal dependencies from setup.py) and then installs via pip. As a virtual machine is already being used, pipenv
  # is superfluous and eliminating pipenv in CI reduces overhead and reduce complexity, while retaining a single
  # location for development dependencies.
